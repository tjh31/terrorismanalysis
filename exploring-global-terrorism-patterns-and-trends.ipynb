ISIS was responsible for numerous large-scale attacks in different parts of the world during this period. Their actions contributed to a surge in terrorist-related violence and casualties.\n\n2. **Syrian Civil War:** The ongoing Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, intensified in the years leading up to 2015. This conflict attracted foreign fighters and led to increased terrorism and violence, not only in Syria but also in neighboring countries and globally.\n\n3. **Global Response:** The increase in terrorist activities by groups like ISIS prompted a global response, including military interventions and coordinated efforts to counter terrorism. These actions might have started to have an impact on the capabilities of terrorist organizations which led to decrease in the number of killings after year 2015.\n\n4. **Counterterrorism Measures:** Many countries implemented stricter counterterrorism measures, enhanced intelligence sharing, and increased security efforts in the aftermath of high-profile attacks. These measures may have hindered the ability of terrorist groups to carry out large-scale attacks further leading to decrease after year 2015.\n\n\nIn summary, the peak in killings in 2015 and the subsequent decrease can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the rise and subsequent decline of ISIS, ongoing conflicts, global counterterrorism efforts, and potential data limitations.

analysis of global terrorist incidents reveals several key insights into the patterns and dynamics of terrorist attacks over the years. These insights shed light on the factors contributing to the rise and decline of terrorism-related killings and provide valuable information for understanding the nature of terrorist incidents.\n\n**1. Rise and Decline of Terrorism-Related Killings:**\n   - The peak in the number of killings by terrorist attacks occurred in the year 2015, followed by a subsequent decrease. This pattern can be attributed to multiple factors:\n     - **Rise of ISIS:** The year 2015 witnessed the significant rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), leading to numerous large-scale attacks worldwide.\n     - **Syrian Civil War:** The intensification of the Syrian Civil War and its global impact contributed to increased terrorism and violence.\n     - **Global Response:** International efforts to counter terrorism, including military interventions and coordinated actions, began to impact terrorist organizations.\n     - **Counterterrorism Measures:** Stricter counterterrorism measures, intelligence sharing, and enhanced security efforts hindered the capacity of terrorist groups to carry out large-scale attacks.\n     - **Data Limitations:** Data reporting variations and limitations may have influenced the decline in reported incidents in more recent years.\n\n**2. Regional Patterns:**\n   - The Middle East & North African region and South Asian region have consistently faced a higher number of killings compared to other regions, indicating ongoing instability.\n\n**3. Attack Types and Targets:**\n   - The most common attack types are bombings/explosions and armed assaults.\n   - The majority of deaths occurred when the targets were citizens of the country, specific properties, military personnel, or the police.\n\n**4. Terrorist Groups:**\n   - Unknown groups account for the highest percentage of killings at 49.8%, followed by the Taliban at 12.8% and ISIL at 11.8%.\n\n**5. Weapons Used:**\n   - Explosives are the primary weapons used, especially in the Middle East & North African and South Asian regions.\n\n**6. Regional Differences:**\n   - Significant differences exist in average fatalities between the Middle East & North Africa region and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n   - Attacks by unknown groups are associated with significantly higher fatalities compared to attacks by known groups.\n\n**7. Attack Types and Total Killings:**\n   - There is no significant difference in total killings between bombing and armed assault attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise and subsequent decline in terrorism-related killings are the result of complex interactions among geopolitical events, global responses, and counterterrorism efforts. The insights drawn from this analysis provide a deeper understanding of the evolving nature of terrorist incidents, which can inform strategies for prevention, response, and international cooperation in countering terrorism.
